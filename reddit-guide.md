# ðŸ’« A Quick Guide to The Reddit API

Are you confused about the Reddit API? This is guide is going to be focused on the Reddit python library, `praw`, and how to use it, get your credentials, etc.

## Getting Started

### Create the application

To view all the apps that you have authorized and created, head to the [reddit prefrences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and create an application.

Fill in the info.

Then, select `script` from
- web app
- installed script
- <mark>script</mark>

and tada! You've created a Reddit application! ðŸŽ‰
Now, let's get those credentials.

### Obtaining Credentials

So here's how to obtain your credentials. After you've created your bot, here's where the credentials are (it can be pretty scary at first.)

So, in this case, my secret would be `Vd9Y20SC4wXOADREYl_B7NZbYrNoXA`, and my ID would be `HnyhhBUeszHSV5Oiol7PSQ`. (Don't worrry- I've deleted the bot, invalidating the credentials.)

## Basic Programs

To start with some basic programs, go ahead and open a terminal/shell program and run `pip install praw`. This will install a python library that's made for handling the reddit API.

Do you want to scrape a subreddit for random titles, perhaps r/showerthoughts?

Well, you can do so using PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper). So go ahead and plug this into your favorite text editor:

```python
import praw

reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id='clientid',
                     client_secret='secret',
                     user_agent='cabinfvr')
```
So, just replace the credentials with yours. The `user_agent`, can literally be anything. Maybe it's `cabinfvr`, or `cabinfvr/1.0`, or something like that. If you want to imitate a web browser (which wouldn't help- but okay.)

Here's some web browsers:

```
Chrome - Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
Safari - Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 13_4) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/16.5 Safari/605.1.15
Firefox - Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/114.0
Opera/GX - Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 OPR/99.0.0.0
```

And now that's all good and said, let's scrape the web.

### Grabbing random posts from a subreddit

So say you want to grab a random post from a subreddit.

Here's a quick program to do that:

```python
import praw
import random
import os

reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id=os.environ['CLIENT_ID'],
                     client_secret=os.environ['CLIENT_SECRET'],
                     user_agent='ShowerThoughtsFetcher/1.0')

subreddit = reddit.subreddit('showerthoughts')

posts = list(subreddit.random_rising(limit=50))
random.shuffle(posts)

non_nsfw_posts = [post for post in posts if not post.over_18]

def get_post():
  return random.choice(non_nsfw_posts).title
```

It return's a random posts title. How it works, is:
- `non_nsfw_posts` checks if its not labeled as `over_18` 
- `reddit.subreddit` checks the subreddit you want.

Here's another program:

```python
import praw
import random
import requests

reddit = praw.Reddit(
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    user_agent="YOUR_USER_AGENT",
)

subreddit = reddit.subreddit("anarchychess")
random_posts = subreddit.random_rising(limit=5)

for post in random_posts:
    print("Title:", post.title)
    print("Description:", post.selftext)
    
    if post.url.endswith(('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif')):
        response = requests.get(post.url, stream=True)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            with open("image.jpg", "wb") as f:
                f.write(response.content)
            print("Image saved successfully.")
        else:
            print("Failed to fetch image.")

    print("---------------------------------------")

```
